# Oystercard

Creating a mock program that allows a user to use a oystercard. Using what we learnt last week, create a complex system which usues TDD, Ruby and object-orientation design.

## Learning Objectives

* Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
